# Vaid-parenthesis

The valid parentheses problem involves checking that:

all the parentheses are matched, i.e., every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.
the matched parentheses are in the correct order, i.e., an opening parenthesis should come before the closing parenthesis

This is a practice solution to the valid parenthesis problem from leetcode but with defined unittest to ascertain the solution
